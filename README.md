# Elasticsearch Online Census Application


This program utilizes POST and GET endpoints to conduct an online census. It has a class called "User" that contains attributes such as Name, Age, City, Address, Occupation, and Income. The program allows individuals to submit their information through the POST endpoint, and retrieve the collected data through the GET endpoint. You can also retrieve all the registered users using the GET/users endpoint.  This program can be used to gather and organize demographic information for a specific population.
